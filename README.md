**Title:**  
On the Potential of Fuzzy Integral-based Decision-level Fusion when the Fuzzy Measure is Informed by Densities Alone  
  
Not avaliable online yet  
This algorithm is only a case study of a three-source fusion task  
  
**Describtion**  
You can simply run 'main.py' to obtain the reults  
The outputs from two datasets are avaliable online:  
Combined_dataset.txt: The high accuracies dataset  
iLab_dataset.txt: The low aacuracies dataset  
  
**How to obtain the outputs**  
You can directly use the avaliable outputs
  
**OR**  
  
You can first find the origin datasets at 'https://github.com/gyhandy/Humanoid-Vision-Engine'  
  
You can then obtain the pre-trained ResNets and follow the steps to obtain the outputs at 'https://github.com/yifanwang97/Explainable-fuzzy-integral'  
For the Combined dataset, we use '8.pth', '16.pth' and '23.pth' in '1\_fuzzy\_integral\_fold1/data/all\_datasets/model' correspond to 'color', 'shape' and 'texture' respectively  
For the iLab dataset, we use '15.pth', '21.pth' and '16.pth' in `iLab/model' respectively
